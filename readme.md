# Ansible Playbooks
This repository collects ansible playbooks used for managing my own machines.  

## Testing
To test whether the ansible command is working on your machine, you can run a
`ansible all -i inventory-local/inventory -m ping` and you should see a `pong`
in return.

## Basic Usage
Typically playbooks within this repo are run locally.  The command below assumes allowing the `ansible.cfg` file to use the `inventory-local` folder to define inventory(which in this repo's case is localhost)

`ansible-playbook developer.yml`

## Variables
Variables should be stored at the inventory level, e.g. `local/group_vars`, unless they are role specific, in which case they should be in that role's `vars` folder.  

## Tags
Some tags are used at the play level to describe what the tasks are doing.  They can be used to skip or include certain tasks using `--skip-tags` or `--tags` accordingly.  

Current tags in use:
